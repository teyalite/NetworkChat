# Network Chat
This project is about building a network chat software. It will allow local network connection and also connections through internet.
For this project I will use TCP/IP protocol to make sure that a message is entirely sent to the destination.
The project will be based on the model Client/Server.

## How Chat works:
For now, i will keep some functionalities simple, i may make them more complex in the future.
A client send a message to the server.
The server distribute the message to all connected clients and it will be shown on their windows.
